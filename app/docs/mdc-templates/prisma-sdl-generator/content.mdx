# Prisma SDL Generator (Removed in v9)

> **This generator has been removed in PalJS v9.** Only Nexus code-first generation is supported. If you need SDL output, generate a Nexus schema and use `printSchema()` from `graphql`:

```typescript
import { makeSchema } from 'nexus';
import { printSchema } from 'graphql';
import * as types from './generated/paljs/nexus';

const schema = makeSchema({ types });
const sdl = printSchema(schema);
```

See the [Generator documentation](/docs/packages-generator) and [Upgrade Guide](/docs/upgrade-guide) for the v9 approach.
