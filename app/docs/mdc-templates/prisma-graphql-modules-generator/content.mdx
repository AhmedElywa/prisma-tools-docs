# Prisma GraphQL Modules Generator (Removed in v9)

> **This generator has been removed in PalJS v9.** Only Nexus code-first generation is supported. The GraphQL Modules architecture is no longer generated by PalJS.

If you need modular GraphQL architecture, use the generated Nexus types and organize them manually:

```typescript
import { makeSchema } from 'nexus';
import * as types from './generated/paljs/nexus';

const schema = makeSchema({ types });
```

See the [Generator documentation](/docs/packages-generator) and [Upgrade Guide](/docs/upgrade-guide) for the v9 approach.
